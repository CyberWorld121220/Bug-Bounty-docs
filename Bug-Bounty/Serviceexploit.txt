NFS and rpcbind ( port 111 or 2049) : this vulnerability will exist in system only if we can see , nfs service in 111 port list


                       NFS , Network File system is used to share files or direcotries within the network, we can mount the directory of remote computer to our device.
                     
                     if port 111 or 2049 is open : check by below command for mountable direcotries :
                        showmount -e IP_ADDRESS 
                        let outcome is :
                           /home IP_1,IP_2
                           /var *
                           
                           => it means only IP_1 and IP_2 can mount /home directory but everyone on the network can mount /var
                           
                           mounting /var => say the file system type is NFS
                            mkdir /tmp/mountingfolder
                            mount -t nfs IP_ADDRESS:/var /tmp/mountingfolder
                            
                            now we can list the content of /var , just by listing /tmp/mountingfolder
                   example : kenobi machine thm : 
                       Your earlier nmap port scan will have shown port 111 running the service rpcbind. This is just a server that converts remote procedure call (RPC)  
                       program into universal addresses. When an RPC service is started, it tells rpcbind the address at which it is listening and the RPC program number its prepared to
                       serve. 

                           In our case, port 111 is access to a network file system. Lets use nmap to enumerate this.

                           nmap -p 111 --script=nfs-ls,nfs-statfs,nfs-showmount 10.10.168.147
