FILES
 /etc/sudoers =>
   root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL – this line means that the root user has unlimited privileges and can run any command on the system
   %admin ALL=(ALL) ALL – the % sign specifies a group. Anyone in the admin group has the same privileges as of root user
   %sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL – all users in the sudo group have the privileges to run any command
   boxlogin ALL = ALL, !/bin/su  – user "bologin" can run all command with sudo , but not the su command to get root shell
   
   Note: It is recommended to use visudo to edit the sudoers file. Visudo makes sure that sudoers is edited by one user at a time and provides necessary syntax checks.
   
 /etc/group =>
   it contains information regarding group and its users , each line is written in below format 
   
       GROUP_NAME:x(WHICH_REPRESENT_PASSWORD_WHICH_IS_NULL):GROUP_ID:LIST_OF_ALL_GROUP_USERS_SEPARATED_BY_COMMA
   

Current problem:

user ALL=(ALL) ALL

Solution

user ALL = ALL, !/bin/su
